# Downloads-Sorter

Created this small script to automatically sort my downloads folder. If you want to use it, put all of the files from this repository into a single folder and launch SorterGui.py.
After launching SorterGUI.py you have to press the sort button.
The script will automatically create folders for specific filetypes and puts those filetypes there.

GUI is shit right now, but I will probably finish it later. No promises.

*This is one of my first projects, so It's pretty bad

# Downloads-Sorter

Created this small script to automatically sort my downloads folder. If you want to use it, put allo of the files from this repository into a single folde and launch SorterGui.py

GUI is shit right now, but I will probably finish it later. No promises.


*This is one of my first projects, so It's pretty bad
